# Changelog

All notable changes to RatioForge will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Network**: Fixed Cloudflare HTTPS tracker connection hanging caused by missing `Connection: close` and Keep-Alive loops.
- **Network**: Fixed private tracker scrape URL generation when the passkey follows `/announce/`.
- **Network**: Repaired `sendEventToTracker` return logic so it correctly registers successful updates and initiates periodic background timer ticks.
- **UI**: Resolved silent `StackOverflowException` crash due to asynchronous `updateCounters` infinite fallback loops on exception.
- **UI**: Fixed bug in `SetPrecision` crashing the app when parsing highly precise fractional ratios with native culture decimal separators (e.g. `2.9E-5`).

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **UI**: Fixed an issue where newly added clients (qBittorrent 5.1.2, uTorrent 3.6.0) were not visible in the client selection list (Fixes #2, Fixes #3).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Critical Runtime Error**: Fixed `System.NotSupportedException: No data is available for encoding 1252` by registering `CodePagesEncodingProvider`. This is required for .NET 8 to support legacy encodings widely used in torrent files.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Network**: Fixed HTTPS tracker connections on .NET 8 by integrating `SslStream` support.
- **Upload**: Fixed critical bug where upload speed dropped to 0 if 0 leechers were reported.
- **VersionCheck**: Updated remote version check to use GitHub raw content and improved semantic version parsing.

### Added
- **Emulation**: Added qBittorrent 5.1.2 and uTorrent 3.6.0 emulation profiles.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-17
